This is a detailed data quality report for the ETL pipeline, highlighting key findings and recommendations for each dataset processed.
Data Quality Report
====================
1. Customers Dataset
--------------------
- Records processed: 26 records
- Duplicates: 1 record
  - 1 duplicate records found based on 'customer_id'.
- Missing Values Handled: 5 records
    - 'email': 5 missing values dropped.
- Records Loaded: 20 records

- Issues:
  - Inconsistent date formats in 'registration_date' (e.g., '15/04/2023', '08-15-2023').
  - Missing email addresses for some customers.
  - Duplicate records based on 'customer_id'.
  - Inconsistent phone number formats (e.g., presence of country code, leading zeros).

2. Products Dataset
-------------------
- Records processed: 20 records
- Duplicates: 0 records
- Missing Values Handled: 4 records
    - 'price': 3 missing values filled with average price per category.
    - 'stock_quantity': 1 missing value filled with 0.
- Records Loaded: 20 records

- Issues:
  - Inconsistent capitalization in 'category' (e.g., 'Electronics', 'fashion', 'ELECTRONICS').

    - 'customer_id': 3 missing values dropped.
